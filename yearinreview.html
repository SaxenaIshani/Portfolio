            <br>
            <p>After finishing my first year at the University of Cincinnati, I believe that I have grown exponentially both 
                intellectually and emotionally. With the world being thrown into a pandemic, a lot did not make sense, especially 
                since this was the first time I have been away from my family for such a long time. This year marked a lot of changes 
                for me, from the fact that I switched my major from CS to IT (Cybersecurity and Software Development Track) to handling 
                my social life amidst a pandemic. Towards the end of my first semester here at UC, I came to the realization that I 
                wanted to do more than CS, I wanted to understand how the cyberspace works and the threats we face everyday. 
                With the help of a few  new friends in the Cybersecurity major I was able to slowly navigate in the overwhelming field of 
                cybersecurity offence and defense. 
                </p><br>
                <p>It was quite a journey for me since I had to do a lot of learning and had to sensitize myself to a whole new realm of
                 technology and how we perceive it. While in the process of making this decision to switch my major, I felt like I did 
                 not want to lose out on certain aspects of CS, and my advisor helped me figure out the perfect path for me: a double major
                  in Cybersecurity and Software Development.
