            <br>
            <p>After finishing my first year at the University of Cincinnati, I believe that I have grown exponentially both 
                intellectually and emotionally. With the world being thrown into a pandemic, a lot did not make sense, especially 
                since this was the first time I have been away from my family for such a long time. This year marked a lot of changes 
                for me, from the fact that I switched my major from CS to IT (Cybersecurity and Software Development Track) to handling 
                my social life amidst a pandemic. Towards the end of my first semester here at UC, I came to the realization that I 
                wanted to do more than CS, I wanted to understand how the cyberspace works and the threats we face everyday. 
                With the help of a few  new friends in the Cybersecurity major I was able to slowly navigate in the overwhelming field of 
                cybersecurity offence and defense. 
                </p><br>
                <p>It was quite a journey for me since I had to do a lot of learning and had to sensitize myself to a whole new realm of
                 technology and how we perceive it. While in the process of making this decision to switch my major, I felt like I did 
                 not want to lose out on certain aspects of CS, and my advisor helped me figure out the perfect path for me: a double major
                  in Cybersecurity and Software Development.

                While I made huge leaps in my intellectual self, I feel like this year has not been very forgiving for me in the aspect of making friends. This year I lost many people I once held dear ,while I made some friendships that I believe will last me a lifetime. This year I realized that some friends you make on the internet might be a better support for you than those that you know in real life. I am still learning how to step out of my comfort zone and I hope that I can be a better person and a better friend to the people in my life right now. I hope that I can grow into a version of myself that I can proud of and can make the change in this huge world that my younger self wanted me to make. I wish to build myself in a way that my parents, my friends, and my future self (and of course my dog) will be proud to celebrate.
                
                I hope the next few years help me become a person who is full of light and hope!
